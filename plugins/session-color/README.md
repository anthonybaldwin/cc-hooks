# Session Color

Tint the terminal background by [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) session status, so you can tell at a glance — across a wall of panes — which session is working, which needs you, and which is done.

| State | Color | Fires on |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 🟡 **working** | amber | `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `ElicitationResult` |
| 🔴 **needs you** | red | `PermissionRequest`, `Elicitation` |
| 🟢 **done / idle** | green | `Stop` |
| ⬛ **reset** | default | `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd` |

It flips **back** to amber after a red prompt (via `PostToolUse`), so a session that asked for permission mid-task doesn't get stuck looking like it still needs you.

Red is reserved for *actual* blocking decisions (`PermissionRequest`, `Elicitation`). The `Notification` event is deliberately left unwired: it fires for `permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt`, `elicitation_*`, and `auth_success` — every one already covered by a more specific event above. In particular `idle_prompt` (idle ~60s after finishing) would just repaint an already-green session, so coloring on `Notification` adds nothing but conflicts.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add anthonybaldwin/cc-plugins
/plugin install session-color@cc-plugins
```

The hooks are registered by the plugin itself. On **macOS and Linux** that's it — restart Claude Code. On **Windows** run `/session-color:setup` once to build the native exe (see below).

## How it works

The tint is a single [OSC 11](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Operating-System-Commands) escape (`ESC ] 11 ; #rrggbb BEL`) written to the terminal. The catch, on every platform, is *getting the escape to the right pane*: hooks run with their stdout captured by Claude Code and **without a controlling terminal**, so a naive `printf ... > /dev/tty` fails (`Device not configured`) and the color silently never lands.

`hooks/session-color.sh` is a tiny POSIX dispatcher (one `hooks.json` serves every OS) that hands the state word to the platform implementation:

- **macOS** (`macos/session-color.sh`) — walks up the process tree to the Claude process and writes the escape to *its* real tty device (the pane's pty, e.g. `/dev/ttys003`). Per-pane, so concurrent sessions never clobber each other. Fullscreen-safe: in `/tui fullscreen` Claude draws on the alternate screen but inherits the background rather than painting opaque cells, so the tint shows through (confirmed in [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)).
- **Linux** (`linux/session-color.sh`) — same tty walk, but **tmux-aware**: inside tmux raw OSC 11 escapes get intercepted and don't reliably reach the pane, so it maps the resolved pty to its tmux pane id and colors it natively with `tmux select-pane -P bg=…`. Outside tmux it falls back to OSC 11 on the pty.
- **Windows** (`windows/`, Rust) — there is no `/dev/tty`. The exe walks up the process tree to the `claude` process, `AttachConsole()`s to **its** console — the pane's pseudoconsole ([ConPTY](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/)) — and writes the escape to `CONOUT$`. ConPTY relays it to the terminal; per-pane for free.

### Windows setup

The exe has to be built once with [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (PowerShell 7 `pwsh` runs the script). `/session-color:setup` does it:

```
/session-color:setup
```

It builds `session-color.exe` and stages it in the plugin's persistent data directory (`~/.claude/plugins/data/…`), which is where the dispatcher runs it from — the plugin's own install path changes with every version, the data directory doesn't. Until setup has run the hooks are silent no-ops. Needs [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) on a recent Windows 11 build: older ConPTY swallows OSC 11, in which case the tint silently won't appear.

### Requirements

- **macOS**: a terminal that honors OSC 11 under the alternate screen (e.g. Ghostty).
- **Linux**: under tmux, 2.1+ (hex colors need 2.2+) with truecolor on so the tints land faithfully:
  ```tmux
  # ~/.tmux.conf
  set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
  set -ag terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:RGB"
  ```
  Over SSH nothing extra — `TERM` rides the pty, so as long as the server has the `tmux-256color` terminfo, color just works. Outside tmux, any emulator that honors OSC 11 (VTE/GNOME Terminal, Kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty); `xterm` honors it but not under the alt-screen.
- **Windows**: Windows Terminal, recent Windows 11, Rust to build.

## Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall session-color@cc-plugins
```

removes the hooks (and, on Windows, the staged exe with the data directory). To reset a pane that's still tinted: `printf '\033]111\007'`, or `/session-color:setup --uninstall` which does that for you.

## Customizing

Edit the hex values at the top of `macos/session-color.sh` / `linux/session-color.sh`, or in `paint()` in `windows/src/main.rs` (then re-run `/session-color:setup` to rebuild). Keep them dim — they fill the whole pane, so bright values hurt text contrast.

```sh
case "$1" in
  working) seq='\033]11;#574515\007' ;;   # amber — working
  needs)   seq='\033]11;#501d22\007' ;;   # red   — needs you (blocking)
  done)    seq='\033]11;#233f20\007' ;;   # green — done / idle
  reset|*) seq='\033]111\007'        ;;   # reset bg to terminal default
esac
```

To change which status a given event maps to, edit `hooks/hooks.json` (one entry per event; the argument is the state). Plugin edits apply on the next session or `/reload-plugins` when the checkout is added as a local marketplace; for marketplace installs bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
