# CC Hooks — session-color
#
# Tint the terminal background by Claude Code session status, via OSC 11.
# Pure hooks: no launcher, no per-session theme files. Works in /tui fullscreen
# too — Claude inherits the terminal background rather than painting opaque
# cells, so an OSC 11 change to the pane's background shows through.
#
# THE CATCH this solves: hooks run WITHOUT a controlling terminal, so a naive
# `> /dev/tty` fails ("Device not configured") and the color never lands.
# Instead we walk up the process tree to the Claude process and write the escape
# to its real tty device (e.g. /dev/ttys003) — the terminal pane's pty. That
# makes the tint per-pane, so concurrent sessions never clobber each other.
#
# States (wired into ~/.claude/settings.json by install.sh):
#   working  amber   -> UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure,
#                       ElicitationResult            (Claude is busy; you wait)
#   needs    red     -> PermissionRequest, Elicitation
#                                          (blocked: Claude needs a decision)
#   done     green   -> Stop               (turn finished / idle; your move)
#   reset    default -> SessionStart, SessionEnd
#
# Note: Notification is intentionally NOT wired. It fires for permission_prompt,
# idle_prompt, elicitation_*, and auth_success — every one already covered by a
# more specific event above (PermissionRequest, Elicitation, ElicitationResult,
# Stop). Coloring on it only double-paints; idle_prompt in particular would
# repaint an already-finished (green) session for no reason.
#
# Tweak the hex values below; dim tints keep text readable across the pane.
